i have provided the whole project along dataset and notebook file named as **"Arslan Ali.ipynb"** In this notebook, we will build an automatic credit card approval system using machine learning techniques.
This nodebook consist of 12 cell and each cell has different purposed  .
### Steps and concrpts are divided in cells

*9     Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set*

*10    Making predictions and evaluating performance*

*11     Grid searching and making the model perform better*

*12     Finding the best performing model*
