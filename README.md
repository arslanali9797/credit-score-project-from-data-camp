# credit-score-project-from-data-camp
Description
this project is about Commercial banks  which receive a lot of applications for credit cards apprvals. Many application got rejected for different reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report.
Manually analyzing these applications is real issue which lead to other issues like  error-prone, and time-consuming (we know thai time is money). 
In this notebook, we will build an automatic credit card approval system using machine learning techniques.
This nodebook consist of 12 cell and each cell is implemented by any purpose.
steps are divided in cells
1     -> load the data set
2     -> Inspecting the applications/data
3,4,5 -> handling with missing value
6,8   -> Preprocessing the data 
7     -> Splitting the dataset into train and test sets
9     -> Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set
10    -> Making predictions and evaluating performance
11    -> Grid searching and making the model perform betterÂ¶
12    -> Finding the best performing model

each cell contain further  more details
